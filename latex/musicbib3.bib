  abstract = {We present a polynomial algorithm for the inductive  inference of a
large class of context free languages, that includes all regular
languages. 
The algorithm uses a representation which we call
Binary Feature Grammars based on a set of features, capable of
representing richly 
structured context free languages as well as some context sensitive
languages. 
More precisely, we focus on a particular case of this representation
where the features correspond to contexts appearing in the language.
Using the paradigm of positive data  and a membership oracle, we can
establish that all context free languages that satisfy two
constraints on the context distributions can be identified in the
limit by this approach. The polynomial time algorithm we propose is  based on a
generalisation of distributional learning and uses the lattice of context
occurrences. 
The formalism and the algorithm seem well suited to natural language
and in particular to the modelling of first language acquisition. }

Here, we describe and evaluate the potential contributions of MTurk to psychology and other social sciences. Findings indicate that: (a) MTurk participants are slightly more representative of the U.S. population than are standard Internet samples and are significantly more diverse than typical American college samples; (b) participation is affected by compensation rate and task length but participants can still be recruited rapidly and inexpensively; (c) realistic compensation rates do not affect data quality; and (d) the data obtained are at least as reliable as those obtained via traditional methods. Overall, MTurk can be used to obtain high-quality data inexpensively and rapidly.}},
